## For Other Mods

Glass Mithrix is Glass again instead of naked.

Void Eradicators are less unfinished:
- Enables some particles
- Adds price transform
- Item models wont randomly be shrunk down a ton.
- Doesnt vanish when too close to camera
- Suppresed Scrap is tiered and usable, but kept hidden from log.
- Suppresed Items tab wider so item icons arent clipping

Multiple of my mods have Perfected nonLunar enemies or add Void Suppressors and rely on better AIBlacklist.\
But those changes dont affect vanilla much, if at all.
