This mod and all it's features should work regardless if anyone else has it installed.

This includes stuff that other mods have as Server-Side (such as Item loss messages)

Some features were cut when I made this mod ClientSide, [See here.](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoQoL_OptionalExtras/)

Everything configurable ingame via RiskOfOptions. 

If something isn't working, or something should be configuerable that isn't, tell me.
