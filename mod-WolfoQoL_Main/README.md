This mod and almost all its features should work regardless of if you're Host, Client, and playing with people who don't have the mod.
 
[GameplayQoL](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoQoL_Gameplay/) and [Server-Sided](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoQoL_OptionalExtras/) are split into their own mods.

This mod has a lot of sections, and a lot of stuff.
Highly customizable so should be able to use 1 section, if only 1 section is desired.

Everything configurable ingame via RiskOfOptions. 

If something isn't working, or something should be configuerable that isn't, tell me.
