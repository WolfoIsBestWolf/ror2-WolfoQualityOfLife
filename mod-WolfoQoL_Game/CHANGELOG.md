#Changelog
```
v1.1.1
Items that miss the map border or exit too horizontally now also get caught and teleported.

Collective Elites falling out of the map no longer drop keys.

v1.1.0 

Dead Drones falling off or through the map now teleport up.

Made some artifacts selectable in eclipse.

Removed XP Converted from Destination Portal (Moved from LittleGameplayTweaks)

Lava damage now 2% instead of 10% for player allies. 
*(Same as basic enemies, 10% is only meant for players it seems but too much to count it as a fix)

Fixed Command Cubes, Void Potentials, Aur Fragments not getting teleported if they fell off.
