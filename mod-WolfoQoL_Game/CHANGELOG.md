#Changelog
```
v1.1.0 

Dead Drones falling off or through the map now teleport up.

Made some artifacts selectable in eclipse.

Removed XP Converted from Destination Portal (Moved from LittleGameplayTweaks)

Lava damage now 2% instead of 10% for player allies. 
*(Same as basic enemies, 10% is only meant for players it seems but too much to count it as a fix)

Fixed Command Cubes, Void Potentials, Aur Fragments not getting teleported if they fell off.
