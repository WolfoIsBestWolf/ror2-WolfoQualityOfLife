## Info
This mod aims to be highly configureable. You can use Risk of Options to do that ingame.

Every play needs this mod by default.

If you wish to use this mod with players who do Not have the mod, you can enable compatibility for that in the config.\
This will disable multiple features, not really any way around it.

##
Report bugs to @Wolfo.wolfo in the Risk of Rain 2 discord or RoR2 Modding discord.\
If you're reporting a bug that isn't something obvious include the log file.

A lot of things are configurable. If you feel something should be configurable yet it isn't you can suggest it to me.

## Content Disable Config


The config will disable anything related to adding stuff that is indexed/Id driven by the game.\
(Items, Buffs, Projectiles and Effects).\
This means changes related to those, such as Red Oni Merc and Blight Acrid, will be disabled.

If you are a Client when the Host doesn't have the mod additional features likely also do not work.\
Such as Mountain Symbol Stacking, Treasure Reminders, Loss Messages.

#### Mods to Not use alongside this one
This mod already does what those mods do in a different way so they become kind of redundant.\
There shouldn't be any compatibility issues if you use both but I still don't recommend it.
